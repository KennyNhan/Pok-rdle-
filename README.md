# Pok-rdle-

This is a Pokemon guessing game. 

Pokemon that are valid guesses only contain the starter Pokemon from each generation including their evolutions as well as Pichu, Pikachu, and Raichu. 

You will have 5 guesses to guess the correct Pokemon. 

After each guess you will receive indicators to help you know what the correct Pokemon is. These indicators include Generation, Type 1, Type 2, and Evolution. 

Generation: If you guess the correct generation from which the correct Pokemon is, it will be green. If your guess is from an older generation the Pokeball will have an arrow pointing up which indicates the correct Pokemon is from an earlier generation. Vice versa if your guess is from an earlier generation than the correct Pokemon. 

Type 1: If your guess matches the Type 1 of the correct Pokemon the Pokeball will be green, otherwise it'll be red. 

Type 2: If your guess matches the Type 2 of the correct Pokemon the Pokeball will be green, otherwise it'll be red. 

Evolution: If you guess the correct evolution stage of the correct Pokemon the Pokeball will be green. If your guess is an evolution stage below the correct Pokemon the Pokeball will have an arrow pointing up indicating that it is a higher evolution than the guess. Vice versa if the evolution stage is higher than the correct Pokemon.
